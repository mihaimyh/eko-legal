        <h2>Method 1: Delete Account In-App (Recommended)</h2>
        
        <p>
            The fastest and easiest way to delete your account is directly through the Eko app:
        </p>

        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                <strong>Open the Eko App</strong>
                <p>Launch Eko on your device and ensure you are signed in to your account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Go to Profile Screen</strong>
                <p>Tap the profile icon or navigate to your profile/account settings from the main menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Access Account Settings</strong>
                <p>Look for "Account Settings" or "Manage Account" option in your profile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Select "Delete Account"</strong>
                <p>Scroll down to find the "Delete Account" or "Delete My Data" button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Confirm Your Decision</strong>
                <p>
                    Read the confirmation message carefully. You may be asked to:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <li>Re-authenticate (sign in again for security)</li>
                    <li>Type "DELETE" or confirm with a checkbox</li>
                    <li>Provide an optional reason for deletion (helps us improve)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Final Confirmation</strong>
                <p>Tap "Delete My Account Permanently" to complete the process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deletion Complete</strong>
                <p>
                    You will see a confirmation message, and you'll be signed out immediately. 
                    Your data deletion begins processing right away.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="info-box success">
            <strong>✅ Deletion Timeline:</strong> Your account will be deleted immediately, but the 
            complete removal of all data from backups may take up to 30 days.
        </div>

        <h2>Method 2: Request Deletion via Email</h2>

        <p>
            If you cannot access the app or prefer to request deletion via email, follow these steps:
        </p>
